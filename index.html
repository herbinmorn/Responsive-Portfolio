         <p>This is Xiaoquan Zhou. I goes by Sarah. I was born in Tianjin, China. In 2007, I came to California for graduate studies. There I met my husband. We got married in 2012. The next year, we moved to the Greater Seattle Area after graduation. We have 2 kids, a 5-year-old boy and a 19-month-old girl. I am currently a part-time chemistry instructor in a community college.</p>

          <p>My life is busy and also full of fun. Now my daughter is learning speaking new words every day, both English and Mandarin. She says "Share! Share! Share!" when she sees anything she wants. She mumbles "Money~Money~" when seeing little bunnies hopping by. My son loves music, especially the sound of a flute. So I bought him one. He is practicing every day, which is pretty annoying at the beginning. </p>
